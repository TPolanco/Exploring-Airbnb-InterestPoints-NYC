# Exploring-Airbnb-InterestPoints-NYC

### Welcome!

I created this project to explore the relationship between NYC Airbnb listings and interest points using SQL, Python, and Tableau. 

To begin, please access the Jupyter Notebook (the .ipynb file). I've outlined my steps for this project there!

Some quick pointers:

- The data folder contains the data I use (sources can be found in the Jupyter Notebook).
- The .sql and .rpt file correspond to the work I did using SQL. 
- The .py files correspond to database connections. The file creds.py contains a template for a SQL Server connection that can be filled with one's own credentials.
