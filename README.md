# Exploring-Airbnb-InterestPoints-NYC

### Welcome!

I created this project to explore the relationship between NYC Airbnb listings and interest points using SQL, Python, and Tableau. 

To begin, please access the Jupyter Notebook (the .ipynb file). I've given more extensive background information for this project there! 

File pointers:
- The data folder contains the data I use (sources can be found in the Jupyter Notebook).
- The .sql and .rpt file correspond to the work I did using SQL. 
- The .py files correspond to database connections. The file creds.py contains a template for a SQL Server connection that can be filled with one's own credentials. 

To run the code:
- Download the excel data in the data folder.
- Update the creds.py file with your own SQL Server credentials.
- Run the airbnb_interestpoints.sql file.
- Run the Exploring_Relationship_AirbnbHomes_InterestPoints_NYC.ipynb file (the Jupyter Notebook).
